# Capacitive Touch UI Panel Integration

This repository contains design optimization details for integrating a **Capacitive Touch UI Panel** with an embedded **wireless print module**.

## üîß Project Overview

The objective of this project is to streamline the **user interface experience** by embedding a capacitive touch panel into a print device. This includes:

- Technical program manager from concept to production collaborating with EE hardware, firmware, Mechenical complaince, relibility and operations team.
- Touch panel signal integrity and grounding optimization
- PCB layout considerations for capacitive sensing
- Integration with embedded mictocontrollefor touch sensing
- Power routing for touch controller and communication module
- Size reduction of PCB
- Optimization from a 2 Chip to single IC solution
- Additional optimization by removing signal conditioning buffers.
- Changing mechenical attach method and collaboration with ME team on attaching the display to the ITO Glass
- Qualifying a lower cost audio circuit and speaker.
- New design is backward compatible with legacy design, enabled plug and play detection with Firmware team for smooth roll over into production
